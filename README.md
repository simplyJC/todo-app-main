## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla Javascript
- Sortable Jquery


### What I learned

This is the hardest challenge that I take in frontendmentor. I took me a long time to figure out how to code a Todo App in javascript with the help of some resources I found in the internet. Somehow I was able to make it. I know there are still a lot of modifications needed but this is by far the solution that I can do. 

### Continued development

I am still a beginner in Javascript. There is still a lot to learn. I am looking forward to take more Javascript challenges to further enhance my learning.
